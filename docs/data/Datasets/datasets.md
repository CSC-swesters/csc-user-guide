# Datasets

Dataset is a collection of data. Typically it consists of data files or database tables related to one a single topic. Examples of datasets include Corpus of Old Literary Finnish, ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules and MovieLens dataset of movie recommendations.

Datasets are the corner stone of data driven computing and data analysis. Datasets allow to focus on the origin, life cycle and ethical use of data resources, instead of the technicalities of single data files or computing methods. CSC provides services for dataset oriented research and develops future services to better support datasets and other higher level aspects of data.

The ownership, copyrights and license of data is often best defined for the whole dataset, though in some cases finer-grained definitions might be needed. In scientific writing dataset is usually cited as a single entity.
