## Overview

# CSC Cloud Services for Sensitive Data Management

**Sensitive Data Connect** and **Sensitive Data Desktop** are Web user interfaces which allow you to:
1. access your own secure and personalized cloud computing environment 
1. securely compute and process sensitive data with your colleagues and collaborators without the needs of generating multiple copies of your data
1. store(for the project duration) and easily share/collect encrypted sensitive data 

## Getting access
Instructions to get user account and a project to access CSC's services:
1. [Create a user account](how-to-create-new-user-account.md)
1. [Create](how-to-create-new-project.md) or [join a project](how-to-add-members-to-project.md) . Next described (using the **Personal data Handeling form**) what type of sensitive data you are processing, who is the data owner and sign CSC Data Processing Agreement (contact your institution legal office).
1. [Add service access for your project](how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md) to SD Desktop and to Allas (in case you want to use SD Connect, a user interface for CSC cloud storage solution called Allas)
1. [Apply for billing units](how-to-apply-for-billing-units.md) or
   [disk quota](how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md)

## Useful terminology:

**Virtual machine (VM)**: is a virtual computing environment which works like a real-physical computer. It has a processor, memory and operating system but it exists only as a code or a partition of the host computer. VMs used for the Sensitive Data Services currently support only Linux operating system and are completely isolated from the internet for security reasons. 

**Virtual machine Flavor (VM Flavor)**: a flavor defines the resources and configurations of a cloud computing environment. It specifies the compute, memory, and storage capacity that can be assigned to virtual machine. 

**CSC Project**: All your data in CSC belong inside a project. You can have one project or multiple projects. When you set up a project you can add project members, you need to define a project manager, and you need to described which type of sensitive data you are processing. 

**Bucket**: is a container in which all your data/ files/directories are stored. You can have multiple buckets for each project. Each bucket is accessible just to you, all the project members and CSC users you personally give access to using MyCSC or SD Connect.Tthe container name is visible to the internet. 

**CSC Project ID** : It can be sourced using the following command          or from this link        or from SD Connect User . It defines and it is used for

**CSC Project name**: MY CSC project ID (NNNNN)

**SD Connect Account**:
