# Using application software in SD Desktop. 

SD Desktop privides a remote Desktopt view to a Virtual Machine running at an isolated could environment at CSC. The virtual machie contains a limited set of pre-installed software (listed below).

Users are allowed to install their own user level software to SD Desktiop, but this can be quite diffucult. As SD Desktop is isolated from internet you can't use istallation tools like _git_, _coda_ or _pip_ that are depended on internet connections to external repositories. Further, SD Desktop users don't have superusers access to their virtual machine, so they can't do any opeartion that need superuser access.

In practice the only reasonable way to add your own software to your SD Desktop is to build a Singulary container outside SD Desktop and then import the Singularity ilmage through SD Connect to SD Desktop.


## Pre-installed software in Sensitive Data Desktop (SD Desktop)

All the following software  are pre-installed on each computing enviroment (or VM flavour) accessible from SD Desktop.
  
### Basix Linux Desktop 

**Operating system: Centos 7 with GNOME desktop**

Pre-installed software: 

* Python 3.7.9 including following packages: 

tensorflow nltk spacy scikit-learn seaborn plotly bokeh pydot xgboost lightgbm catboost eli5 torch keras dist-keras elephas gensim scrapy beautifulsoup4 numpy scipy pandas statsmodels matplotlib pyfuse3 crypt4gh trio httpx qrcode 

* Go 1.16 
*	Libreoffice (currently being installed) 
 
## Scientific Analysis Desktop 

**R / RStudio Server Singularity container**

General concept: 

* R + RStudio Server versions matched with Puhti r-env-singularity module 
* First production version based on r-env-singularity/4.0.5 (R 4.0.5 + RStudio Server 1.4.1106, MRAN snapshot dating to xxxx, Bioconductor 3.12) 


Wider installations in container: 

* CentOS7 + long list of libraries 
* Python 
* 1000+ R packages (JH will add link to install script) 
* GIS software (PROJ, GDAL, SAGA) 
* CUDA drivers 
* TensorFlow (used with R TensorFlow back-end) 
* JH will add links to container recipe files 

Requirements from VM perspective: 

* Sif file in appropriate location (e.g. /opt/r-env-singularity/4.0.5) 
* Singularity 
* Browser (Firefox) 
* Launch scripts in /usr/bin (4 in total: single- and multi-threaded R / RStudio) 
* Many R packages assume / require web access to function properly, setting up connections will depend on user 
* Things JH ran on Anvil 
* Yum-installed Singularity + created folder in /opt 
* Downloaded sif + launch scripts from Allas, made scripts executables
