## User Information ( this should be changed to Project information before the 22th)

Behind the **User information** button in the front page, a user information dashboard is displayed. The dashboard displays statistics about the current resource usage, e.g.

## Shared

In the **Shared** page you can:


* in **Shared to the project** visualize the containers or bukets that other CSC users shared with you: 

From this view the shared access can be revoked, a new share initiated, or existing access synchronized to the sharing back-end, thus enabling it to be queried from the back-end in the future. (?)

* in **Shater with the project** visualize the containers or bukets that you shared with other CSC users: 

From this view the granted access can be viewed, and any container can be opened just like when using the normal container browsing view. All features available in the ordinary container view work, such as downloading, uploading (if write access is granted to the container) and copying the container.
