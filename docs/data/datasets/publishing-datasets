# Publishing datasets

Often dataset oriented work produces new datasets, either as primary outcomes or possible as supporting material to primary results, such as scientific publications. When 
publishing datasets, the focus should on enabling new work to be carried on them at some undefined point in future. Publishing should be based on commonly accepted standards
and definitions of good metadata, as datasets might be used in contexts that are completely different from the project that produced them. However, often the most important 
future user for datasets is the original author, so that the effort spent on publishing data properly is often quickly paid back.
