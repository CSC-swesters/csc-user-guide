# Datasets

## Overview

A dataset is a collection of data. Typically it consists of data files or database tables related to one a single topic. Examples of datasets include Corpus of Old Literary Finnish, ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules and MovieLens dataset of movie recommendations.

Datasets are the corner stone of data driven computing and data analysis. Datasets allow to focus on the origin, life cycle and ethical use of data resources, instead of the technicalities of single data files or computing methods. CSC provides services for dataset oriented research and develops future services to better support datasets and other higher level aspects of data.

The ownership, copyrights and license of data is often best defined for the whole dataset, though in some cases finer-grained definitions might be needed. In scientific writing dataset is usually cited as a single entity.

## Gathering datasets

The first phase of dataset driven work is where datasets are gathered. It is possible to locate and take into use existing well-defined datasets or to create new datasets by sourcing data and organising it into datasets. The gathering phase lays the foundation on which data-driven computing and analysis is built on. During this phase the focus should be on making sure licenses and terms of use for data are known and match the intended use, asserting that the origin for data is known for good provenance and that data is organised and documented well.

### Datasets by discipline

CSC hosts or provides access to several datasets on different platforms.

### Biosciences
[ChEMBL](../apps/chembl.md) Database of bioactive molecules.
[Chipster_genomes](../apps/chipster_genomes.md) Tool to download aligner indexes used by the [Chipster software](https://chipster.csc.fi/index.shtml) to Puhti

### Chemistry
[CSD - Cambridge Crystallographic Database](../apps/csd.md) – organic and metallo-organic crystal structures and tools
[Molport 6M molecule database](../support/tutorials/gpu-shape.md) preprocessed for fast GPU screening with Schrödinger Shape

### Geosciences
[Open Finnish spatial datasets are available in Puhti or in Allas.](spatial-data-in-csc-computing-env.md)

### Language research and other digital humanities and social sciences
The latest versions of [CLARIN PUB or ACA licensed corpora](https://www.kielipankki.fi/corpora/) are available unpacked in /appl/data/kielipankki/
