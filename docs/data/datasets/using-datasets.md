# Using datasets

<a name="header1"></a>

## Overview 

In this phase the actual processing and analysis of data is being done. Here the focus is on data and getting the best possible results. Work should be supported by techniques that make data processing easy and fast, as well as help in maintaining reproducability and provenance of data throughout the pipelines built."

### What if the dataset terms of use are made by the producers themselves?

The dataset creator reserves the right to specify the terms of use for their dataset, even without ready-made licenses. In such cases, the terms of use specified must be observed, but you can also negotiate the terms of use by contacting the owner of the dataset.

### What if no terms of use have been specified for data?

If there are no terms of use or the terms of use given are unclear, you should always contact the owner of the dataset in question.
