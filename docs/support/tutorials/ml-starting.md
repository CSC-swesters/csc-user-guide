# Getting started with machine learning on Puhti

*You have some machine learning code in Python running on your laptop, but it's
really slow. You've learned that moving to GPUs and CSC's Puhti supercomputer
might be the answer but the documentation seems a bit daunting.*

CSC's computing environment is well-documented at <https://docs.csc.fi>, but for
a newcomer it might be a bit difficult to know how to get started. **This guide
will show you, step by step, how to get your codes and data to Puhti and running
on GPUs**.

When you are moving your code from your laptop to the Puhti supercomputer, it's
important to acknowledge that Puhti isn't just a "faster laptop". Because of the
fundamental difference in scale, some things work quite differently in a
supercomputer. So **be prepared to take a step back and relearn some things
about how computing is done**. We consider this a reasonable price to pay for
getting access to Finland's most powerful GPU resource for researchers!

## Step 1: getting a CSC user account

First of all, you need to get a CSC user account. If you work or study at a
Finnish university just go to <https://my.csc.fi> and click "Get Started".
Select Haka-Login and your university from the pull-down menu. After that you
should be able to log in with your normal university credentials.

For [more information, and special cases, check our separate "How to create new
user account" documentation](../../accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account.md).

<!-- ## Step xx -->

<!-- PyTorch code from github, CIFAR data? Own code, or from recent paper? -->
<!-- `pip install --user`? -->


<!-- ## Step nn: slurm -->

<!-- Puhti is a supercomputer cluster, which means that it's a collection of hundreds -->
<!-- of computers. Instead of running programs directly, they are put in a queue and -->
<!-- a scheduling system (called "Slurm") decides when and where the program will -->
<!-- run. -->

<!-- - gputest -->


<!-- ## Step last: check results -->

<!-- Check slurm*out etc etc. -->
