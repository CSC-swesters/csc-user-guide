# GDB with source view (VIM) using TMUX
[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a is a terminal multiplexer. It allows to start a session and then open any number of windows (virtual terminals) inside that session. With tmux is possible to run several applications within the same terminal window, either side-by-side or in different windows (tmux screens). Processes running in tmux will continue to run when their window is not visible and even when disconnected. 
The commands in tmux are issue by first issuing the prefix ```ctrl+b```. Then follws the command. Pressing ```c``` creates a new windows. To change between windows one uses the prefix followed by a digit or using the letters ```p```, ```n```, ```l```, or ```w```. Inside a window one can using panels. The current window can be splitted in panes using the prefix  followed by ```%``` (for horizontal split) or ```"```(for vertical split).
