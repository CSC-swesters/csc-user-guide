# Rahti container cloud

Welcome to the Rahti container cloud! If you are not yet
familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
the topic:

  * [What is Rahti?](/cloud/rahti/rahti-what-is/)
  * [Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts](/cloud/rahti/concepts/)

If you are already familiar with container technology and Kubernetes/OpenShift concepts,
you could move directly to the Quota and Billing sections:

  * [Project and Quota]()
  * [Billing]()

If you already know about the quotas and the billing of projects in Rahti, you could move directly to the instructions for getting access to Rahti:

  * [Getting started](/cloud/rahti/usage/getting_started/)

If you already have access to Rahti, then you can skip ahead to usage
documentation and the links to external documentation:

  * [Storage](/cloud/rahti/)
  * [Images](/cloud/rahti/)
  * [Tutorials](/cloud/rahti/)
  * [External documentation ](/cloud/rahti/ext_docs/)
