# Guide for students

Instructions on using the CSC Notebooks environment as a student.

## Joining a course

If you are a student in a course that uses the CSC Notebooks environment, you will be provided a _join code_ by the course organizer.
Once you have the code, you can visit [the Notebooks application](https://notebooks-beta.rahtiapp.fi), login with any of the [supported login methods](getting_started.md/#how-to-login-to-csc-notebooks), then find the `Join workspace` button on the top right corner of the Notebooks home page. Enter the join code in the popup and click the `+` button. If that succeeded, it will guide you to your courses workspace, from where you can find your courses application from the list. If it did not succeed, á¹•lease verify that your copied the join code correctly and there are no trailing whiltespaces.

You can then start the application by using the power control button on the right of the application. A new tab will open with your application.

## Self-learning

1. After logging in, you will be presented with a list of publicly accessible *applications*. The applications that 
   have self-learning material included are marked with `self-learning` label.
2. Start a session of any application by using the power control button on the right. A new tab is opened for
   your session. If your browser blocks this pop-up, you can click on the power control again to enter the session.
3. When you are finished, delete the application session using the power control button.
4. The running application session will be deleted automatically if the session exceeds its lifetime. Lifetime is 
   shown next to the power control button. The remaining time is visible in the power control button itself.

!!!Note

    Public applications do not support saving your session or data. If you want to keep your content, please download it
    locally before your session ends.
