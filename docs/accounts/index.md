# Accounts

## Overview

To get access to CSC services, you usually need a project and a user account
for each user. There are five steps to setting them up:

1. [Create a user account](how-to-create-new-user-account.md)
1. [Create](how-to-create-new-project.md) or
   [join a project](how-to-add-member-to-project.md)
1. [Add service access for your project](how-to-add-service-access-for-project.md)
1. [Apply for more billing units](how-to-apply-for-resources.md) or
   [disk quota](how-to-increase-disk-quotas.md), if needed
1. [Renew your password](how-to-change-password.md) annually

All these tasks can be performed in the
[self-service portal MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).

CSC services are free of charge for users of Finnish higher education
instututions and state research institutes when they use the services for
academic research, teaching or training.
[Usage consumes billing units](billing.md), but no money is charged for it.
However, billing units must always be positive.

The Puhti supercomputer has its own partition for the Finnish Meteorological
Institute.

FMI users are also allowed to use the general partition of Puhti with normal
projects.
[See the specific instructions for FMI users](fmi.md).
