# How to switch between projects

On the Dashboard of MyCSC, there is a chart showing how much resources
you have left in one of your projects. You can change that project as
follows:

1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Profile_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Select the default billing project.
1. Click _Save_.

The selected default billing project is however applied only in the Rahti service, where the resource usage is charged based on this setting.

In other services, billing project is controlled with service-specific tools. See the instructions under _Computing, Cloud and Data_ for more details about project selection in each service:

* In Puhti and Mahti , you [select the billing project in the batch script](../computing/running/creating-job-scripts.md).
* In Allas, you [use the allas-conf command to determine which project is used](../data/Allas/accessing_allas.md).
* In Pouta: TBA
